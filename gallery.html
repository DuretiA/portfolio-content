		I try to take as many pictures as I can while also enjoying myself and being present when on a trip. Taking as many pictures as possible is great 
		for when I want to share my adventures and to look back and remeninsce on. I'm ashamed to admit how many times I run out of storage on trips because 
		of how many pictues I store and never delete but I refuse to miss out on opportunities to document my favorite memories. Below you can find some snippets 
		of moments during my recent travels. I will be adding my favorite pictues from each trip gradually in this photo gallery.

		Picture below are images from both my trips to Tulum, Mexico and Thailand. The first image is from an excursion in Tulum that my friend and I signed up for
		this was the highlight of our trip to Mexico even though we ended up completely covered in mud it was the best money we spent! The following two images are from a restaurant that
		was overlooking one of the beaches and a acai bowl from Matcha Mama. The fourth image is from the museum, Azulik in Tulum, a must vist especially for pictures! The remainding images are
	from Thailand, the highlight for me being the image taken at the elephant sanctuary!!
