		    I solo traveled to Thailand June of 2019. This was the summer after my Junior year in undergrad. I was in Indonesia for a study abroad program the month before and figured,
            "why not?!". I found a super cheap flight for about $60 dollars and made the trip directly to Phuket. Phuket is sort of an island-y type of city. Lot's of tourists come for the amazing beaches and views.
            There seemed to be a pretty lively night life every night but I didn't really explore much at night for safety reasons. During my stay in Phuket I went to a elephant sanctuary where I was able to feed elephants.
            I've always seen people go to Thailand and similar countries and ride elephants but through my research prior I learned how harmful it was to them and opted to go to a sanctuary that actually cares for it's animals. 
            This was such an amazing experience and the staff at the particular sanctuary I went to were so kind (even took some pictures of me for me!).

            I also signed up for a boat tour via airbnb to Phi Phi Islands. Phi phi islands is one of Phuket's many islands. This was a great experience as well except for the fact
            that I did not check the weather before hand and it was storming on the boat ride there. The waves were so big and there was no cover on the boat so we all got pretty soaked.
            After the rain started to clear up though the island was beautiful. The boat tour docked at one of the islands to let tourists swim too. Although I can't swim I still enjoyed
            the boat tour and would reccomend it to anyone! From the culture to the amazing views if Phuket isn't on your list it should be!
