			On this website I'll be posting about my recent out of country travels and documnting the trip details. I'll be
            sharing reccomendations as well as things I learned on the trip. <br>As an avid traveller it's nice I heavily research
            places I want to visit before I go and I want to start storing all that information I learn before/after the trip somewhere <br>
            where others could benefit from them.

			The most recent out of country trip i've taken is to Tulum,Mexico. This was a girls trip right before I started grad school.
            The trip was very spontaneous and last minute but <br>we were able to find cheap flights. This was my first trip out the country since the pandemic. 
            Right before the pandemic I was on a Euro/North african-tour that was partially <br>solo. I was able to visit 
            (Morocco, Spain, Portugal, France and Italy). A few months before my euro tour I was also able to study abroad. 
            During my study abroad in Indonesia, <br>I was able to visit, Thailand and Malaysia. I try to make the most out of a trip by visiting 
            neighboring countries if possible.
