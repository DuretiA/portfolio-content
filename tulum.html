            My friends and I took a trip to Tulum after seeing so many people visit online. We also wanted to take a trip somwhere warm before going back to school.
           We decided on Tulum after comparing it to a few other tropical places. We knew even though the flights were cheap that from what we heard and know about our last trip
           to a different part of Mexico, things get expensive once you're there. We booked an airbnb that had a private pool which was nice but unfortunately the airbnb and the host
           was a nightmare. From the airbnb not being close to any of the central tourist-y areas to us being locked out the airbnb night before our flight. We were able to get our things 
           last minute but I definetly reccomend reading all airbnb reviews because the host wasn't responsive and it seems to be a recurring issue for them according to reviews.

           In terms of what we actually did, we barely slept! We were out early in the morning every day trying to make the most of our trip. From amazing restaurants to 
           thrilling excursions we barely rested. I think the most memorable meal for me was the Salmon I had at rosa negra in downtown Tulum. I still think about that fish to this day
           and reccomend that restaurant to anyone who listens. The atmosphere at the restaurant was a mix of club/restaurant with upbeat music and little sparklers that were
           handed to every guest. It truly was a memorable experience and well worth the wait in line (I do reccomend getting on the waiting list early). We also visited one of the 7 wonders of the world
           which is located right outside of Tulum, the Chichen Itza. It was really cool going with a group and learning about the history of the locals but I wouldn't say I reccomend the tour
           since it was a little pricey. My party and I agreed at the end that we should've just paid the enterance fee ourselves and got a taxi to and from. One of our favorite adventures was an
           experience we booked through airbnb where it was ATV riding, Swimming in a cenote (underground cave w/ water), and ziplining. This was all done in half a day so by the end of it we were EXHAUSTED.
           Although tiring, this was the best part of the trip for all of us and was so much fun!
