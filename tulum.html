		   My friends and I took a trip to Tulum after seeing so many people visit

		    I solo traveled to Thailand June of 2019. This was the summer after my Junior year in undergrad. I was in Indonesia for a study abroad program the month before and figured,
            "why not?!". I found a super cheap flight for about $60 dollars and made the trip directly to Phuket. Phuket is sort of an island-y type of city. Lot's of tourists come for the amazing beaches and views.
            There seemed to be a pretty lively night life every night but I didn't really explore much at night for safety reasons. During my stay in Phuket I went to a elephant sanctuary where I was able to feed elephants.
            I've always seen people go to Thailand and similar countries and ride elephants but through my research prior I learned how harmful it was to them and opted to go to a sanctuary that actually cares for it's animals. 
            This was such an amazing experience and the staff at the particular sanctuary I went to were so kind (even took some pictures of me for me!).
